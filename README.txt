Project Overview

Travel Companion utilizes the Travel Advisor API to fetch detailed information about local restaurants, hotels, and attractions. It then presents this data on an interactive map powered by the Google Maps API. With Travel Companion, you can explore nearby places of interest, read reviews, and plan your next adventure, all in one place.

Please note that the project is currently on a temporary hiatus. Due to the high demand for data, the API calls to Travel Advisor have reached their limit. Rest assured, we're actively working on resolving this issue to provide you with the best user experience possible.
